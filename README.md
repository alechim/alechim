## Hey there 👋

I'm Alec, a software developer based in Las Vegas.

I enjoy to organize and write clean code and I'm working to build full stack applications and games. 

I plan my projects to establish what I need, the scope of the project, and some organization tools like UML diagrams &mdash; GitHub Actions, Milanote, Excalidraw, and draw.io.

As of right now, I am learning more backend development through the bootcamp [boot.dev](https://boot.dev), where I plan to create a public central repository containing all of the projects I complete from there.
